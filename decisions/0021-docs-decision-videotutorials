# Use Markdown Any Decision Records

## Context and Problem Statement

The Documentation squad made a decision to only update tutorial videos once a year at most. We would also like to get help from the engagement team to do these updates. 

## Considered Options

Updating videos once a month or with every release - too much time, effort, no full time documentation team member
Updating videos once a year with major changes - reasonable, would prefer to do in conjunction with engagement team

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Update videos once a year if needed.
