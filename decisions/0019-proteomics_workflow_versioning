# Subclass metaproteomics workflows

## Context and Problem Statement

Version 2 of the proteomics workflow is now avaliable. Version 2 uses kaiko to generate a metagenome reference using machine learning if one does not exist. 
Version 1 of the workflow, which depends on an existing metagenome reference, will contintue to be run. How should these workflows be versioned? 
Existing workflow versioning convention is that if a workflow is return the typecode, shoulder and blade are the same and there is a version increment 
(ex nmdc:wfmp-11-abcd.1 for the first run and nmdc;wfmp-11-abdc.2 for the second run). 


## Considered Options

* {title of option 1}
* {title of option 2}
* {title of option 3}
* … <!-- numbers of options can vary -->

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "{title of option 1}", because
{justification. e.g., only option, which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which resolves force {force} | … | comes out best (see below)}.
